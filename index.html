                    <p>Hi, you can call me <span>"Hally"</span> and I'm located in <span>Toronto, Ontario</span> <i class="fab fa-canadian-maple-leaf"></i>.</p>

                    <p>
                        I want to build excellent web pages and might as well some 
                        software that can improve people's objectives. It's really 
                        cool to turn all those ideas into virtual reality, eh?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, art is another world to me and so is technology, 
                        but then merging these two worlds can absolutely benefit me 
                        to build a masterpiece.
                        Creating and designing a website or any kind of applications 
                        are fun though, but programming can be really challenging because 
                        there is always a lot of problem-solving going on. But to me, 
                        solving even the smallest bug can give me a rewarding feeling. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I am not coding, I sometimes do whatever comes in to my mind. 
                        It could be like watching movies/tv-shows, reading, or sleeping
                        just because I get bored.
